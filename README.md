 - Displays a feed of other users' clothes and accessories they dont want anymore
 - Like or dislike button/swiping feature so the user can input which clothing pieces they're interested in. Then, the next piece of clothing appears
 - If two users like each others clothing, then a match appears and users are able to connect with each other through phone numbers
 - Users can meet up and swap their clothes
